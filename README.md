Backup Script made in python using web plataform and MySQL as database to store timestamp files.

    Dependences modules:
    
  - MySQLdb
  - win32api & win32con
  - Bottle

Clone the reposiory, run sql script on dump directory, run on cmd "python web.py" and enjoy it!!!

Documentation still in progress but the script is intuitive.

At the moment this script isnÂ´t multi-plataform... Be patient!!!!!!
